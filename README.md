Our project will investigate these questions: 

- Does the aspiration of making the world better have an impact on the mid career payment? 
- How does it affect the early stage of a students career? 
- Does it apply to only some specific fields?
- Are more diverse schools likely to have a higher % of alumni who want to change the world?
- Do lower tuition and fees cause people to want to care more about the world? 

We will be using the data available at:
