The aim of this report was to predict early career pay for college graduates from data collected on independent variables such as: tuition costs, school enrollment size, percentage STEM of majors, percentage of minority students, etc. This is an important question for us, as we are college students who are soon entering the workforce. However, the outcomes of this study go beyond just students; this data could help forecast future pay and show the importance (or non-importance) of a college degree. After a robust exploratory data analysis, various regression algorithms were created utilizing the libraries tidyverse, caret, DataExplorer, fastDummies, leaps, cowplot, and GGally. All of the R code can be found at the GitHub here.

We will be using the data available at:
