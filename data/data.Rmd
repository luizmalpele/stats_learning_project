This is where the final project report write-up goes. 
```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
```

Get the data
```{r}
tuition_cost <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_cost.csv')
salary_potential <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/salary_potential.csv')

```

Unused data, may come back to this at a later point 
```{r}
# tuition_income <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_income.csv') 
# 
# historical_tuition <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/historical_tuition.csv')
# 
# diversity_school <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/diversity_school.csv')
```


Rename column from state_name to state so we can join easily
```{r}
colnames(salary_potential)[3] <- "state"
```

Join tuition cost and salary potential
```{r}
college_data <- dplyr::left_join(tuition_cost, salary_potential, by = c("name", "state"))
```

```{r}
glimpse(college_data)
```
